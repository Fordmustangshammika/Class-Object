Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) :

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code.

Object : 
Objects have states and behaviors. Example: A dog has states - color, name, breed as well as behaviors â€“ wagging the tail, barking, eating. An object is an instance of a class.

Class :
A class can be defined as a template/blueprint that describes the behavior/state that the object of its type support.
